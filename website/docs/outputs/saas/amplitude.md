# Amplitude

**ðŸŸ¢ Supported**

This sink writes formatted envelopes to Amplitude for easy visualization and analysis.

:::tip Note!
All nested payload properties are flatted and dot-separated, so this:
```
{
    "topLevel": {
        "secondLevel": {
            "thirdLevel": 10
        }
    }
}
```

Will show up in Amplitude as a property of `topLevel.secondLevel.thirdLevel`, having the value of `10`.
:::


All associated envelope properties are passed along to Amplitude.
