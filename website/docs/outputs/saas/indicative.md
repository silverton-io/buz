# Indicative

**ðŸŸ¢ Supported**

This sink writes formatted envelopes to Indicative for easy visualization and analysis.

:::tip Note!
All nested payload properties are flatted and dot-separated, so this:
```
{
    "users": {
        "jane": {
            "age": 40
        }
    }
}
```

Will show up in Indicative as a property of `users.jane.age` having the value of `40`.
:::


All associated envelope properties are passed along to Indicative.
