# Things to do

- Handle schemas that don't exist at all (automatically invalid event) ✅
    - Done ✅
- Event redirection (valid/invalid) ✅



- Refactor validator
    - Validation should take an event and a schema and that is it.  Should not take a pointer to a cache ✅
- Add endpoint(s) for "generic self describing" events
- Anonymization functionality
